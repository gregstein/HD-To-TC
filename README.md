# Why this HD To TC?

I mainly created this tool to make playing versus famous AIs (such as Barbarian) possible. This tool should be a replacement for compatibility patch. In fact, Once you install "HD To TC Conversion Tool" you no longer need to install it again.. Just once!

Another advantage of using "HD To TC Conversion Tool" is that your Age of Empires II HD on steam will remain untouched. This tool will create a new installation of the game ("200 MB" only) and a shortcut on your desktop to run the game separately.
