# Why HD To TC?

I mainly created this tool to make playing versus famous AIs (such as Barbarian) possible. This tool should be a replacement for compatibility patch. In fact, Once you install "HD To TC Conversion Tool" you no longer need to install it again.. Just once!

Another advantage of using "HD To TC Conversion Tool" is that your Age of Empires II HD on steam will remain untouched. This tool will create a new installation of the game ("200 MB" only) and a shortcut on your desktop to run the game separately.

Features:
- Performs better than Compatibility Patch ( No display errors, no missing fonts, and many other issues that some HD players usually encounter while using compatibility patch for Voobly.)
- Fully functional challenging AIs are included such as (Barbarians, The_Unknown, Gandalf)
- Game Optimized to perform as fast as possible.
- Auto-Configures Voobly to start playing multiplayer instantly without any hassle.
- Small Trees is installed already (viable in offline mode as well)
- HD To TC Conversion Tool is fully compatible with Wololokingdoms and UserPatch.
